# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph (with non-negative weights).

## Formula

$$
d[v] = \min(d[v], d[u] + w(u, v))
$$

## Python Implementation

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    dist = {node: float("inf") for node in graph}
    dist[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    while pq:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if d > dist[u]:
            continue
        for v, w in graph[u]:
            if dist[v] > d + w:
                dist[v] = d + w
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))
    return dist
```

## Interactive Visualization

Hereâ€™s an example of embedding a React component inside MDX:

```mdx
<GraphVisualizer
  nodes={["A", "B", "C", "D"]}
  edges={[
    { from: "A", to: "B", weight: 2 },
    { from: "A", to: "C", weight: 4 },
    { from: "B", to: "C", weight: 1 },
    { from: "B", to: "D", weight: 7 },
    { from: "C", to: "D", weight: 3 },
  ]}
  start="A"
/>
```

## Notes
- Use **Markdown** for text, formulas, and code.
- Use **JSX/React components** for visualization or interaction.

This is the key advantage of MDX over plain Markdown.
